</font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">8.0 - DOS/32 Advanced -
Allocation of &gt;64MB of memory<br>
</font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
of version 6.00 and higher supports allocation of more than 64MB of memory
without using Virtual Memory. This is accomplished by using the Superset
of standard XMS functions, but also puts certain limitations on under which
system softwares the application will run.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In general, allocation
of &gt;64MB of memory is supported only when running with a memory manager
installed, which is the case with XMS, VCPI and DPMI systems. When running
under Clean (INT 15h) system, allocation of more than 64MB is not available
due to the abscence of a memory manager. Furthermore, when running DOS/32
Advanced under DPMI system, the present, &quot;external&quot;, DPMI host
will be responsible for providing the application with memory management
functions and memory allocation. This leaves us with XMS and VCPI system
softwares under which DOS/32 Advanced will use its own, built-in DPMI host
when allocating memory.</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Under XMS system, DOS/32
Advanced will automatically recognize whether the allocation of &gt;64MB
is supported and there is more than 64MB of memory installed into the computer.
If that is the case, DOS/32 Advanced will allocate all free XMS memory making
it available for protected mode programs's use. Otherwise, the DOS Extender
will act in the standard way allocating as much memory as it can. To force
DOS/32 Advanced not to allocate all the available memory you can reconfigure
the DOS Extender and specify the amount of Extended Memory your application
will require. However, DOS/32 Advanced emposes certain requirements for
the XMS server under which it is running: the XMS specification version
must be at least 3.0 for the DOS Extender to be able to use the Superset
of XMS functions, and the computer must have 64MB or more free XMS memory.
If any of these requirements are not met, DOS/32 Advanced will not be able
to allocate &gt;64MB of memory. The maximum amount of memory DOS/32 Advanced
can allocate under XMS is limited to 2GB.</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The things are more complex
when running under a VCPI server. The amount of extended memory DOS/32 Advanced
can allocate under VCPI is controlled by three factors: &quot;Extended Memory&quot;
(see <a href="../util/3.html">SUNSYS Setup Utility</a> documentation), &quot;VCPI PageTables&quot;
and &quot;XMS+VCPI Allocation Scheme&quot;. To allocate &gt;64MB of memory
under VCPI you need to make sure that the VCPI PageTables value is greater
than 16, and the XMS+VCPI Allocation Scheme feature is turned on. Most of
VCPI servers are not capable of providing the client with more than 64MB
(or even 32MB) of memory through EMS allocation mode. The XMS+VCPI Allocation
Scheme feature turned on will ensure that the DOS Extender will allocate
as much memory as it can from the VCPI memory pool (the EMS memory) and
then will try to allocate the rest of the memory (if any) from the XMS.
When running under VCPI, DOS/32 Advanced can allocate up to 256MB of memory.</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Please note: successful
allocation of &gt;64MB of memory depends on many different factors, for
example computer's BIOS vendor and BIOS' ability to provide the memory manager
with the correct information about amount of physical memory present, installed
memory manager and its ability to correctly determine the type of BIOS and
make use of all the available physical memory and so on. Although allocation
of more than 64MB of memory is a relatively simple process, it is vital
that both the hardware and the software support it. If you are having problems
with allocation of &gt;64MB, try using another memory manager or switch
to another system software. We highly recommend using XMS system as it is
fast and more reliable than VCPI. But if you must use the VCPI system, make
sure to configure the DOS Extender the right way, as suggested above. </font></p>
