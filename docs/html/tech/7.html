</font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">7.0 - DOS/32 Advanced -
Memory Management<br>
</font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Under Clean, XMS and VCPI
systems DOS/32 Advanced will always allocate extended memory at startup
and set up its own memory heap, from which your protected mode program will
receive its memory. This is done so to minimize the amount of calls to the
present system software the DOS Extender otherwise would have to do. Instead,
the memory blocks, also called Extended Memory Blocks or EMBs, will be dynamically
allocated, resized and deleted on your program's requests, internally by
the DOS Extender accessing only its own memory heap. Under DPMI system,
it will be up to the present, &quot;external&quot; DPMI host to provide
your program with extended memory, as DOS/32 Advanced built-in DPMI server
will never be installed and used.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Under VCPI system, the
allocated physical memory will be represented by (mapped into) linear memory
which in its turn is described by Page Tables. The Page Tables will be dynamically
allocated by DOS/32 Advanced at startup in the conventional (DOS) memory,
and the number of allocated Page Tables will directly depend on how much
physical memory is present in the computer and is accessible to the DOS
Extender through the installed VCPI server. Each allocated Page Table will
map 4MB of linear memory, but will also take up 4KB of DOS memory. Thus,
if a computer has 256MB of memory installed, the DOS Extender will allocate
256MB / 4MB = 64 Page Tables which will take up as much as 64 * 4KB = 256KB
of DOS memory. Consequently, if a computer has 1GB of memory installed,
the allocated Page Tables will consume 1MB of DOS memory, which is way too
much. To prevent such situations, DOS/32 Advanced will limit the number
of Page Tables to a certain value, VCPI PageTables, which can be manually
adjusted by the user using the <a href="../util/3.html">SUNSYS Setup Utility</a>
program. The default value of VCPI PageTables is 64, which allows DOS/32 Advanced
to allocate the maximum of 256MB of memory.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Please note that DOS/32
Advanced DOS Extender of version 6.00 and higher will not allow allocation
of more than 64 Page Tables, limiting the maximum amount of possible allocated
memory to 256MB. Also, if the Page Tables take too much of valuable DOS
memory (the case when you have alot of physical memory installed in the computer)
you can manually lower the VCPI PageTables value to turn down DOS memory requirements.
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
also has another feature, VCPI+XMS Allocation Scheme, which allows to control
the amount of allocated extended memory under VCPI. Due to the design of
VCPI, the system will have two different pools of memory: one reserved for
EMS and the other for XMS. As the VCPI hosts are installed on top of XMS
servers, they will by the rule allocate the memory from XMS and reserve
it for EMS pages. An example would be a very popular VCPI/EMS server, &quot;EMM386&quot;
by Microsoft, which is required to be installed on top of the XMS, &quot;HIMEM.SYS&quot;.
Despite the two different system memory pools, DOS/32 Advanced will be able
to allocate all accessible memory from the both VCPI and XMS when VCPI+XMS
Allocation Scheme feature is turned on (see <a href="../util/3.html">
SUNSYS Setup Utility</a> documentation for further explanation).</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When calling DOS/32 Advanced
DPMI memory management functions (DPMI functions 05xxh), the DOS Extender
will always perform an internal check of all Extended Memory Blocks to see
whether their integrity is in good shape and none has been overwritten or
corrupted. Although this feature can be disabled with the SUNSYS Setup Utility
program for the &quot;retail&quot; versions of your protected mode programs,
it is recommended that you keep it enabled when developing applications
as this is a good way to make sure that none of the routines in your program
is corrupting the memory. As soon as DOS/32 Advanced detects that one or
more of the Extended Memory Blocks are overwritten or corrupted in some
way, it will terminate your application with an error. This protection against
Extended Memory Blocks overwriting is more than 99 per cent secure, and
if this error is triggered by the DOS Extender, you will know for sure what
exactly is wrong. </font></p>
