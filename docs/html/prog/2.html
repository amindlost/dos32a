Overview<br>
</font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender has a built-in Advanced DOS Protected Mode
Interface (ADPMI) which provides your protected mode program with nearly
full subset of DPMI v0.9 functions. The &quot;DPMI&quot; is a standard, which allows
protected mode applications to get an access to the extended memory, switch
into or out from protected mode and invoke real mode software. DPMI API is
accessed through software interrupt INT 31h in protected mode with function
number is placed in register AX. On successful return, registers will
contain values/information returned by the DPMI host and the carry flag will
be cleared. If the function is not supported by the DPMI host, or DPMI host
could not perform the action desired by  the function, it will return with
carry flag set and an error code placed in register AX. Note that some
implementations of DPMI do not return error codes, but only set the carry
flag. DOS/32 Advanced built-in DPMI will always return error codes in AX.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">On startup, DOS/32 Advanced
DOS Extender will detect what system is in place and if there is an external
DPMI host present. Depending on configuration, the DOS Extender will look
for VCPI and DPMI in different orders. If configured to look for VCPI first
and DPMI second, the DOS Extender will detect and initialize the VCPI server
even though a DPMI host might be present. However, a DPMI host may always
deny the presence of VCPI. In that case the DOS Extender will detect and
initialize DPMI instead. If neither VCPI nor DPMI are installed, DOS/32
Advanced will look for XMS and if even it is not present, initialize and
use Clean (INT 15h) system.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When running under Clean,
XMS or VCPI system softwares, DOS/32 Advanced will always install its built-in
DPMI server, ADPMI. Otherwise, the present DPMI host (&quot;external DPMI&quot;)
will be initialized and used. Note that some of DPMI implementations can be
quite buggy and unpredictable; some of them will run your protected mode
code at CPL 0, some at CPL 3, some will execute real mode calls in Real
mode and some in Virtual 8086 mode. Due to all this complications DOS/32
Advanced will try to be very careful when accessing external DPMI hosts and
interfere with them as little as possible.</font></p>
