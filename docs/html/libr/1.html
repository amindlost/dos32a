1.0 - DOS/32 Advanced D32A Library - Introduction
<br></font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
DOS/32 Advanced D32A C/C++ Run-Time Library is a collection of routines
with C/C++ language interface. The primary goal when designing the library
was to ensure maximum performance and speed while keeping the size of the
library, and thus the size of executable applications that use it as small
as possible. The library functions provide access to the low level DOS
Extender and DPMI features which otherwise require the use of the assembly
language.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
D32A C/C++ Run-Time Library is fully compatible with WATCOM C/C++
version 10.6 and higher, and supports the both stack based and register
based calling conventions. To use functions provided by the library you need
to include the line <i>#include &lt;d32a.h></i> into your source files. Many of the
library's functions duplicate those present in the standard C/C++ Run-Time
library provided with WATCOM C/C++, but perform better and take less space
(such as <i>d32a_malloc()</i> function). Therefore you may want to use <i>#undef</i> and
<i>#define</i> keywords to redirect some of the standard functions to D32A
library enhanced functions.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
It is important to note that some, but not all, of the library's
functions require DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender as they are using its
extended features not found in other DOS Extenders. A minor drawback is that
when debugging an application with WATCOM Debugger, the program will be run
under DOS/4G DOS Extender where DOS/32 Advanced features are not present.
You are suggested to use SUNSYS Debugger provided with DOS/32 Advanced DOS
Extender to ensure that the applications you debug will work correctly
during the debugging process.</font></p>
