 Preface
*********

    Hello  and  welcome into the world  of  DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
Liberty  Edition  version  8.00 Release 9.  This  is the final release of
DOS/32 Advanced, I will not maintain, support nor advertise it, which is
why  it is being released under  an Apache-like license, allowing nearly
full  freedom  of exploitation of the  software,  and accompanied by the
complete and the original source code of the DOS Extender and its tools.

    This  release  contains  minor  changes  and  bugfixes  only, and is
essentially  a revised version of the release  7 which came out in 1998,
plus  a  new  license  and the source  code.  Now,  looking back at this
project,  I  feel that certain things  could have been done better, many
things should have been done better, and I hope that some things will be
done  better by someone brave enough to  do it. There is always room for
improvement,  still  I am quite happy  with DOS/32A and what it's become
over  the  years. Whoever you are, and  to whatever purpose you use this
product, I wish you good luck and godspeed.

                                          Narech Koumar, over and out...




 1.0 - About DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
******************************************

    DOS/32    Advanced    DOS    Extender    is    a   state-of-the-art,
high-performance,   high-speed,  true  "Plug&Play"  replacement  of  the
world's most popular DOS Extender, DOS/4GW, created by Tenberry Software
(formerly  Rational  Systems  Inc.)  for  WATCOM  C/C++  and  FORTRAN 77
compilers  which allow DOS Extended applications to run in a 32-bit flat
protected mode environment.

    DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender provides full compatibility with WATCOM
C/C++  and  features  one of the  most  complete  software emulations of
DOS/4GW,  thus  allowing  the users to  "plug"  DOS/32 Advanced into the
protected  mode programs which use DOS/4G, DOS/4GW, DOS/4GW Professional
and  any  other  compatible DOS Extenders  without  the need to modify a
single line of code.

    DOS/32  Advanced has been designed and  optimized to be the fastest,
most flexible and highly compatible with other software DOS Extender. It
performs mode translating operations, such as Protected to Real and Real
To  Protected  mode switching, as fast  as machine's hardware allow, and
while being compatible with DOS/4GW, it is the fastest DOS Extender that
supports  WATCOM  C/C++  at this time!  A  large number of configuration
options  allow  DOS/32 Advanced to  be  configured in hundreds different
ways,  either by a special environment  variable or by an external setup
program,  giving its users the ability  to manually adjust the number of
allocated  selectors, callbacks, virtual stacks,  turn off the exception
handling,  change  the size of DOS  transfer buffer and much, much more.
Compatibility  with "Clean" (also known as  "Raw" or INT 15h), XMS, VCPI
and  DPMI system softwares allows DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender to run on
different   machines   with   various   operating   systems   installed.
Additionally,  availability of such features as Null-Pointer Protection,
Extended  Memory  Blocks  Checking and  support  for built-in Debug Mode
turns   DOS/32  Advanced  into  a   powerful  tool  for  protected  mode
programmers  who  want to make  their 32-bit protected mode applications
error-free.




 2.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - What's New in this version
****************************************************

    This  new version of DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender has been optimized
for   use  in  embedded  system   environments  where  size,  speed  and
reliability  play  the essential role.  Improved  protected mode kernel,
removal  of  major  parts of the  DOS  Extender from conventional memory
after   initialization,   improved  exception   handling,   support  for
performance   counters  and  protected  mode  TSR  (Terminate  and  Stay
Resident)  development as well as Year  2000 compliance are the examples
of  the  new features found in  the DOS Extender. A new high-performance
library  provided  with  the  DOS  Extender  allows  developers  to take
advantage  of  the  most features found  in  DOS/32 Advanced and improve
performance of protected mode applications.

    For  more detailed information about the news in this version please

low  level  functions and commands required  by the DOS Extender for its
proper  operation. DOS/32 Advanced has been  tested on, and proved to be
fully  compatible with the following  OS listed: MS-DOS(R) versions 5.00
thru 8.000, Microsoft Windows(R) version 3.xx, Windows 95, Windows 98 and
Windows  ME, Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later),
Windows  2000,  Windows XP and IBM  OS/2.  According to the reports from
DOS/32 Advanced users the DOS Extender has proven its compatibility with
OpenDOS and Linux (DOS Emu) Operating Systems.

    Reportedly,   DOS/32   Advanced   DOS   Extender   has   shown   its
incompatibility  with Multiuser DOS 7 Gold Operating System developed by
Concurrent  Controls (formerly Digital Research)  company. Please take a
note  of  our  official statement: we  have  not  tested DOS/32A on MDOS
hosted   machines  internally,  and  therefore  we  cannot  confirm  any
potential problems between the said Operating System and DOS/32 Advanced
DOS  Extender,  nor can we provide any  technical support in the case of
combination of the two above said software.

    DOS/32  Advanced  DOS Extender has been  tested  and proved its full
compatibility with WATCOM C/C++ v10.6 and v11.0.

    In  addition, DOS/32 Advanced has been tested and proved to be fully
compatible  with  over  a 100  software  titles, including games, demos,
utilities  and commercial/shareware programs  which use DOS/4G, DOS/4GW,
DOS/4GW Professional, PMODE/W and CauseWay DOS Extenders.

 8.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - Year 2000 Compliance
**********************************************

    Supernar  Systems, Ltd. have tested the time/date conversion code in
DOS/32  Advanced DOS Extender and  the utility programs accompanying it,
such  as SUNSYS Bind, Compress and  Setup Utilities and SUNSYS Debugger,
and  have  identified  no  programming  errors  adversely  affecting the
transition from the year 1999 to the year 2000 (a leap year).

    Supernar  Systems,  Ltd.  believes and  certifies  that  the current
shipping  version  of DOS/32 Advanced  DOS  Extender software product is
Year 2000 compliant.


    Please note that Year 2000 problem is a complicated issue because it
is  possible  that  problems could  arise  through interactions with the
compiler   run-time  library,  user  application  code,  and  underlying
MS-DOS(R)  or  Windows(R)  operating system  (or  the simulation you are
using).  Accordingly,  all  users  who  are  concerned  with  Year  2000
compliance  should test all Year 2000 features at the application level,
to  satisfy  themselves  that everything works  all  the way down to the
hardware.




 9.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - Redistributable Components
****************************************************

    For  information about DOS/32 Advanced  DOS Extender Liberty Edition
usage  and  distribution refer to  DOS/32  Advanced DOS Extender Liberty
Edition  Software  License, file "license.txt"  located in the directory
into which DOS/32 Advanced was installed.

Note:
-----
When  distributing  DOS/32  Advanced DOS  Extender  Liberty Edition as a
whole,  it  is  strongly  adviced (although  not  required)  to ship the
