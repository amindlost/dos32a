1.0 - Synopsis
==============
This is a DOS (Dead Operating System) Extender. It extends DOS. By how much
or for how long still remains a mystery. It lives in a refrigerator. It has
a wonderful ability to piss off one's dearest neighbors by sporadically
electrocuting their cats. Incidentally it also makes the farm sheep go b‰‰‰.



2.0 - System Requirements
=========================
A puter and a pint of Guiness... Actually, you can replace puter with women.
Guiness, however, is mandatory.



3.0 - Release Notes
===================
Avril Lavigne rocks! Kent - ni ‰r sÂ j:a bra! Vitja Tsoy (Kino) - s ponikshej
golovoj, v tvoju pamjat'...

=========
Q: What's new?!
A: Oh, not much. Just the same old shit wrapped up nicely in a new package.

Q: I've found a bug, yippie! Now what?
A: Pin it on a wall. Alternatively send it in, I collect them!

Q: WTF?! I can't build from your sources.
